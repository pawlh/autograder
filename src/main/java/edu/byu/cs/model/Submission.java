/**
 * Represents and stores a student submission.
 *
 * @param netId Identifies the student who submitted the code.
 * @param repoUrl Points to the GitHub repo where the code is stored.
 * @param headHash The commit hash at which we graded the submission.
 * @param timestamp The time the submission was handed in.
 * @param phase The phase being graded in this submission.
 * @param passed Signifies that the code passed all the grading tests.
 *               <b>Does NOT signify</b> that the score was approved.
 * @param score <p>The final score assigned to this submission (in points) that will
 *              be sent to the grade-book, including penalties and extra credit.</p>
 *              <p>This field will be updated if the score changes because of
 *              additional penalties or manual corrections; however, this is
 *              <b>not the canonical source of truth</b>.</p>
 *              <p>This serves as convenient reference while within the AutoGrader
 *              for many reasons, but the real source of truth is the grade-book.</p>
 * @param notes Additional notes displayed to the user.
 *              These usually represent the status of their score, or
 *              provide remarks about why a passing score was not given.
 *              These sometimes contain directions to meet with a TA, etc...
 * @param rubric Contains detailed breakdowns of the score.
 * @param admin Flag identifies when the submission was started by an
 *              admin or developer for testing purposes.
 *              Among other behaviors that may be different, these
 *              submissions will never be stored in the grade-book
 * @param verifiedStatus <p>The status of the verification.</p>
 *                       <p>Old submissions will have a `null` value;
 *                       in this case, verification is assumed to equal
 *                       the {@link Submission#passed} field.</p>
 * @param verification Represents the manual approval of the submission.
 *                     Added only after the submission is approved manually.
